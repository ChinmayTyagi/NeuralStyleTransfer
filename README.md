# NeuralStyleTransfer

How do humans perceive artistic imagery? This project, created by Chinmay Tyagi, Michael Auld, and Tycho Bellers, aims to create artificial artwork by manipulating an image to adopt the visual style of another image. Eg, "Picasso-fy" a selfie of myself to adopt the style of one of his paintings. 

### Demo
Run the included `demo.py`. Note that it can take a few minues to run on CPU. Increasing the number of epochs will make the output look better but currently the demo only does 1 epoch so it doesn't take too long.
