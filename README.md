# NeuralStyleTransfer

How do humans perceive artistic imagery? This project, created by myself, Michael Auld, and Tycho Bellers, aims to create artificial artwork by manipulating an image to adopt the visual style of another image. Eg, "Picasso-fy" a selfie of myself to adopt the style of one of his paintings.
